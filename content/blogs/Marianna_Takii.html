<p>My name is Marianna Taki and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Cyprus an island in the Mediterranean. Here is an image of one of the best beaches in Cyprus: <img src="https://www.visitcyprus.com/media/k2/items/cache/ca9456ad89fef6c66a71b99b32dfe05e_XL.jpg" /></p>
<p>For the past three years I have been studying and living in the UK. I studied <i>BSc Mathematics</i> at the University of Bath. My undergraduate degree was one of the most important steps in my life as it not only taught me how to exercise critical thinking but it also introduced me to programming and data analysis. This was when I knew that this is a field that I feel passionate about and want to explore more and encouraged me to apply for the <i>Masters in Analytics and Management</i> at LBS.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite modules during university include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied Statistics</li>
<li>Introduction to Econometrics</li>
<li>Optimization Methods of Operational Research</li>
</ul>
<p>In my free time I love to cook and exercise. For the past 2 years, I have developed a passion for walking and exploring different areas of Bath and Cyprus through exercising. I have walked multiple natural trails these past few months and feel that this new hobby has allowed me not only to improve my mental and physical health but also to discover the place I live in a different way. I am excited to do the same once I move to London.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have been a volunteer from a very young age starting from secondary school and continuing in University. One of the most exciting projects I participated in was when volunteering for the V Team last year, the largest volunteering cohort of the University of Bath. As a Project Leader I managed to keep volunteering active during the pandemic for the entire academic year and carried out exciting projects to help our local community such as helping charities recruit new volunteers and sending out Christmas essentials to families in need.</p>
